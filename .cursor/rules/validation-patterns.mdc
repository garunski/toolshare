* Use `zod` everywhere; server schemas are the single source of truth.
* Share schemas by importing or through `.pick()`, `.omit()`, `.extend()`â€”never duplicate code.
* Throw on the first invalid input; catch and handle at the API boundary.
* Export `z.infer<typeof schema>` types alongside each schema for strong typing.
* Co-locate form-side schemas with forms and server-side schemas with their API handlers.
