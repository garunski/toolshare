* `page.tsx` orchestrates the view; keep ≤ **150 lines**. Break into colocated components otherwise.
* Use named component folders with `index.tsx`; place sub-components in `fields/`, `parts/`, etc.
* Avoid generic names such as `util`, `helper`, `common`, or `shared`—names must express intent.
* Derive client-side validation schema from the server schema to avoid duplication.
* Prefer `use<FormName>Form.ts` (or `use<FormName>State.ts`) for non-trivial form state.
