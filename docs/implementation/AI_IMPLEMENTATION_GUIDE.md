Your task is to implement phases by first exploring the existing codebase to understand current structure and completed features, then strictly adhering to repository standards: maintain 150-line file limits, use descriptive naming conventions, avoid deep relative imports, enforce TypeScript strict mode with Zod validation, and never modify files in `src/primitives/`. Review the relevant phase documentation to understand requirements, create a structured implementation plan that breaks work into focused, manageable components, then execute the plan incrementally by building one file at a time and running `task dev:lint-fix && task dev:type-check` after each completion to ensure code quality and type safety throughout the development process.
