# Phase 1: Admin Foundation Overview

## Purpose
Establish Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and admin infrastructure required for the comprehensive item data collection system. This phase creates the foundation that all subsequent phases depend on.

## Critical Repository Rules
- **File Size Limit**: All files MUST be under 150 lines
- **Naming**: Use anti-generic naming conventions (specific, descriptive names)
- **Imports**: No deep relative imports (../../../) - use absolute paths via @/ alias
- **Commands**: Use `task` commands for all operations (`task dev:lint`, `task dev:format`, etc.)
- **DO NOT modify files in `src/primitives/`** - these are protected UI primitives
- **Component Placement**: Page-specific components go in page/components/, shared in src/components/

## Current State Analysis
- Basic authentication exists via Supabase Auth (`src/common/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- No user roles or admin functionality currently implemented
- Database has basic user profiles but no role tables
- Need to bridge from current basic user system to full RBAC

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Verify current authentication system is working (`src/common/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- [ ] Confirm Supabase is set up and running (`task database:status`)
- [ ] Check existing database schema (`supabase/migrations/20240101000000_initial_schema.sql`)
- [ ] Verify no admin tables exist in current schema
- [ ] Confirm task commands work (`task dev:lint`, `task dev:format`)

## Phase 1 Components

### 1. Database Schema (`database-schema.md`)
- Roles and permissions tables with proper relationships
- User role assignments with RLS policies
- Migration file with complete SQL implementation

### 2. Role Operations (`role-operations.md`) 
- Core business logic for role management
- Permission checking functions
- Integration with existing authentication system

### 3. Admin Routes (`admin-routes.md`)
- Complete admin interface structure
- User management and role assignment UIs
- Protected route implementation

### 4. API Endpoints (`api-endpoints.md`)
- RESTful APIs for admin operations
- Request/response specifications
- Authentication and permission middleware

### 5. Authentication Integration (`authentication.md`)
- Enhanced session management with roles
- Updated auth hooks and utilities
- Role-based navigation and redirects

## Success Criteria
- Admin user can log in and access admin dashboard at `/admin`
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- User role assignment works through admin interface
- All new code follows repository naming conventions
- Database migrations applied successfully
- All files under 150 lines with proper imports
- Code quality checks pass without errors

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Admin infrastructure fully functional
- User roles and permissions system working
- Admin can assign roles to users
- Protected admin routes accessible only to admins
- Foundation ready for dynamic category/attribute management
