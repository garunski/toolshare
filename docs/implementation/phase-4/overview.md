# Phase 4: Dynamic Forms Overview

## Purpose
Implement dynamic form generation system that renders category-specific fields based on attribute definitions, with real-time validation and best-in-class UX. This phase transforms the item creation/editing experience into a dynamic, category-driven interface with professional taxonomy support.

## Critical Repository Rules
- **File Size Limit**: All files MUST be under 150 lines
- **Naming**: Use anti-generic naming conventions (specific, descriptive names)
- **Imports**: No deep relative imports (../../../) - use absolute paths via @/ alias
- **Commands**: Use `task` commands for all operations (`task dev:lint`, `task dev:format`, etc.)
- **DO NOT modify files in `src/primitives/`** - these are protected UI primitives
- **Component Placement**: Page-specific components go in page/components/, shared in src/components/

## Prerequisites Check (from Phase 3)
- [ ] Admin can fully manage categories and attributes
- [ ] Item data collection system can be configured through admin interface
- [ ] Category-attribute associations working correctly
- [ ] Admin interfaces operational and tested

## Current State Analysis
- Static item creation forms exist
- Dynamic data model ready
- Need to transform forms to be category-driven
- Need dynamic validation based on attribute definitions

## Phase 4 Components

### 1. Dynamic Form Engine (`dynamic-form-engine.md`)
- Core form rendering engine
- Field type mapping and rendering
- Dynamic validation system
- Form state management

### 2. Category-Driven Item Forms (`category-item-forms.md`) 
- Enhanced item creation/editing forms
- Category selection drives field display
- Real-time form updates
- Progressive disclosure patterns

### 3. Field Renderers (`field-renderers.md`)
- Individual field type components
- Custom validation integration
- Accessible form controls
- Rich field types (date, select, multi-select, etc.)

### 4. Form Validation (`form-validation.md`)
- Dynamic validation rule processing
- Real-time validation feedback
- Cross-field validation support
- Custom validation messages

### 5. User Experience Enhancements (`ux-enhancements.md`)
- Form progress indicators
- Auto-save functionality
- Smart defaults and suggestions
- Mobile-responsive design



## Success Criteria
- Dynamic forms render correctly based on external taxonomy category selection
- All attribute types supported with appropriate field renderers
- Validation works correctly for all field types
- External category selection from 5000+ categories is fast and intuitive
- Form state management is robust and performant
- User experience is intuitive and accessible
- Forms work seamlessly on mobile devices
- All files under 150 lines with proper imports

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Dynamic form system operational
- Item creation/editing uses category-specific forms
- Foundation ready for external taxonomy integration
- Form system can handle complex validation rules
