# Phase 6: Advanced Features & Optimization Overview

## Purpose
Implement advanced UX features, real-time updates, performance optimizations, and data governance processes for the complete item data collection system. This phase adds polish, scalability, and enterprise-ready features to the platform.

## Critical Repository Rules
- **File Size Limit**: All files MUST be under 150 lines
- **Naming**: Use anti-generic naming conventions (specific, descriptive names)
- **Imports**: No deep relative imports (../../../) - use absolute paths via @/ alias
- **Commands**: Use `task` commands for all operations (`task dev:lint`, `task dev:format`, etc.)
- **DO NOT modify files in `src/primitives/`** - these are protected UI primitives
- **Component Placement**: Page-specific components go in page/components/, shared in src/components/

## Prerequisites Check (from Phase 5)
- [ ] External taxonomy integration operational
- [ ] Auto-population working reliably  
- [ ] Data quality measures in place
- [ ] All core functionality implemented and tested
- [ ] System ready for optimization and advanced features
