# Phase 3: Admin Interface Overview

## Purpose
Build comprehensive admin interfaces for external taxonomy browsing, attribute definition management, and user role administration. This phase creates the administrative tools needed to manage the professional item data collection system established in Phase 2.

## Critical Repository Rules
- **File Size Limit**: All files MUST be under 150 lines
- **Naming**: Use anti-generic naming conventions (specific, descriptive names)
- **Imports**: No deep relative imports (../../../) - use absolute paths via @/ alias
- **Commands**: Use `task` commands for all operations (`task dev:lint`, `task dev:format`, etc.)
- **DO NOT modify files in `src/primitives/`** - these are protected UI primitives
- **Component Placement**: Page-specific components go in page/components/, shared in src/components/

## Prerequisites Check (from Phase 2)
- [ ] Dynamic categories and attributes system operational
- [ ] Items can have category-specific properties
- [ ] Database schema with Categories, Attribute Definitions, and Items tables
- [ ] Category and attribute operations working
- [ ] Foundation ready for admin interface development

## Current State Analysis
- Admin infrastructure exists from Phase 1
- Dynamic data model exists from Phase 2
- Need admin interfaces to manage categories and attributes
- Need enhanced user management with role-specific features

## Phase 3 Components

### 1. External Taxonomy Browser (`category-management.md`)
- External Product Taxonomy browsing interface
- Hierarchical category tree navigation (5000+ categories)
- Category search and filtering by external ID or path
- Category-attribute association management for external categories

### 2. Attribute Management Interface (`attribute-management.md`) 
- Attribute definition creation and editing
- Validation rule configuration
- Option management for select/multi-select types
- Attribute preview and testing

### 3. Enhanced Admin Dashboard (`admin-dashboard.md`)
- Expanded analytics with category/attribute metrics
- System health monitoring
- Recent activity feeds
- Quick action shortcuts

### 4. Item Administration (`item-administration.md`)
- Admin oversight of all items
- Bulk item operations
- Category migration tools
- Data quality reporting

### 5. User Role Enhancements (`user-role-enhancements.md`)
- Enhanced user management with category permissions
- Role-based category access controls
- User activity monitoring
- Advanced role assignment features



## Success Criteria
- External taxonomy browser fully functional with 5000+ categories
- Fast search and navigation through hierarchical taxonomy
- Attribute definition management working correctly
- Enhanced admin dashboard providing comprehensive system overview
- Item administration tools operational with external category assignment
- User role management enhanced with new capabilities
- All interfaces follow Catalyst UI design patterns
- Admin workflows are intuitive and efficient for large taxonomy
- All files under 150 lines with proper imports

## Next Phase Dependencies
- Admin can fully manage categories and attributes
- Item data collection system can be configured through admin interface
- Foundation ready for dynamic form generation
- System prepared for external taxonomy integration
