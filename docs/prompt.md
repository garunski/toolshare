# AI Implementation Prompt

## 🎯 Your Task

You are helping refactor a Next.js App Router application called "ToolShare" from a problematic architecture to a clean, maintainable structure.

## 📚 Available Documentation

1. **`docs/plan.md`** - High-level refactoring strategy and 10-phase overview
2. **`docs/rules.md`** - Architectural standards and coding rules
3. **`docs/phases/phase-X-[name].md`** - Detailed implementation guide for each phase

## 🚀 Implementation Process

### For Each Phase:
1. **Read the specific phase document** to understand objectives and steps
2. **Analyze the current codebase** to understand what needs to change
3. **Implement changes step by step** following the detailed instructions
4. **Use verification checklists** to ensure quality
5. **Test functionality** to ensure nothing is broken

### Your Responsibilities:
- ✅ Follow the phase documentation exactly
- ✅ Preserve all existing functionality
- ✅ Use the architectural rules as your guide
- ✅ Use `task validate` to test thoroughly after each step
- ✅ Ask questions if anything is unclear

### What NOT to Do:
- ❌ Skip reading the phase documentation
- ❌ Break existing functionality
- ❌ Create abstractions not in the plan
- ❌ Ignore the architectural rules
- ❌ Use custom scripts - only use `task validate` and root-level TASKs

## 🎯 Ready to Start

I'm ready to begin with a specific phase. Please read the relevant documentation and help me implement it systematically.

**Example usage:**
- "Start with Phase 1: Organize Application Sections with Route Groups"
- "Help me implement Phase 3: Move Business Logic to API Routes"
- "I'm stuck on Phase 5, can you help me continue?"
