## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deletion Analysis
Before deleting each file, search for any imports or usage in the codebase.

### Step 2: Delete Files One by One
Delete each file in order of complexity (Low â†’ Medium â†’ High).

### Step 3: Validate After Each Deletion
After each file is deleted, run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes.

### Step 4: Handle Import Errors
If any import errors occur, update the importing files to remove the dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deletion Verification
- [ ] All 10 form builder files identified for deletion
- [ ] No active usage found in codebase
- [ ] All dependencies identified and handled

### âœ… Deletion Verification
- [ ] FormBuilder.tsx deleted
- [ ] MultiStepFormBuilder.tsx deleted
- [ ] DynamicFormBuilder.tsx deleted
- [ ] DynamicValidationEngine.ts deleted
- [ ] FormStateManager.ts deleted
- [ ] FormErrorProcessor.ts deleted
- [ ] FormProgressIndicator.tsx deleted
- [ ] SmartDefaultsProvider.tsx deleted
- [ ] useAutoSave.ts deleted
- [ ] ValidationMessage.tsx deleted

### âœ… Post-Deletion Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by deletions
- [ ] All remaining forms still work correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 10 over-engineered form builder files deleted
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… No functionality broken by deletions
- âœ… All remaining forms still work correctly
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors After Deletion
**Problem:** Other files still import the deleted components
**Solution:**
- Search for all imports of the deleted file
- Remove the import statements
- Update the importing files to use alternatives or remove the dependency

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after deletion
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references to deleted components
- Update type definitions to remove dependencies
- Ensure all imports are properly updated

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing components
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the deleted components
- Test the application thoroughly after each deletion
