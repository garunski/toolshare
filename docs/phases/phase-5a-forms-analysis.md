## üö® Migration Complexity Assessment

### High Complexity (10 files)
- Over-engineered form builders with complex logic
- Files with multiple dependencies
- Files requiring careful removal to avoid breaking changes

### Medium Complexity (8 files)
- Configuration files with moderate complexity
- Files with some dependencies
- Files requiring moderate cleanup

### Low Complexity (11 files)
- Simple utility components
- Files with minimal dependencies
- Files requiring minimal cleanup

---

## üìä Estimated Effort

- **Total Files**: 29
- **High Complexity**: 10 files (34%)
- **Medium Complexity**: 8 files (28%)
- **Low Complexity**: 11 files (38%)

**Estimated Total Effort**: 7 sub-phases, each taking 15-30 minutes
**Total Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## üéØ Migration Strategy

### Delete Strategy
1. **Remove over-engineered components** that violate colocation principles
2. **Delete generic form builders** that add unnecessary complexity
3. **Remove configuration files** that hide intent
4. **Clean up utility components** that are over-engineered

### Replacement Strategy
1. **Create specific forms** colocated with their pages
2. **Use simple form components** with clear intent
3. **Implement validation** directly in forms or API routes
4. **Use primitives** for form fields instead of over-engineered components

*This analysis provides the foundation for creating detailed implementation plans for each sub-phase.*
