# Phase 6e: Social Hooks Migration

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Move 1 social-related hook file from `src/common/hooks/` to be colocated with its respective social functionality.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Migrate (1 file)

### 1. `useProfileActions.ts` â†’ `/app/(app)/social/profile/hooks/useProfileActions.ts`
**Size:** 3.1KB | **Complexity:** Medium

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Create directory: `src/app/(app)/social/profile/hooks/`
- [ ] Copy `useProfileActions.ts` to the new location
- [ ] Update imports to use relative paths and local dependencies
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for profile actions data
- [ ] Add proper error handling for profile actions operations
- [ ] Create corresponding `index.ts` file for exports
- [ ] Update all imports in codebase that reference `useProfileActions.ts`


---

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/\(app\)/social/profile/hooks
```

### Step 2: Move File
Follow the subtasks for the file above.

### Step 3: Update Imports
After the file is moved, update all imports in the codebase that reference the old location.

### Step 4: Create Index File
Create an `index.ts` file that exports the hook.

### Step 5: Validate Migration
After the file is moved, run `task validate` and fix all issues.

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Path Errors
**Problem:** Import paths break after moving hook
**Solution:**
- Update all import statements to use relative paths
- Use IDE refactoring tools to update imports
- Check for any absolute imports that need updating

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after moving hook
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references that need updating
- Ensure all dependencies are properly imported
- Update any type definitions that reference the old location

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing hook import
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the moved hook
- Test the application thoroughly after the move

*Phase 6e focuses on moving the social-related hook to be colocated with its respective social functionality, ensuring clear ownership and maintainability.*
