# Phase 6g: Utility Hooks Migration

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Move 1 utility hook file from `src/common/hooks/` to be colocated with its respective utility functionality.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Migrate (1 file)

### 1. `useLazyLoading.ts` â†’ `/app/(app)/hooks/useLazyLoading.ts`
**Size:** 1.8KB | **Complexity:** Medium

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Copy `useLazyLoading.ts` to the same directory as other utility hooks
- [ ] Update imports to use relative paths and local dependencies
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for lazy loading data
- [ ] Add proper error handling for lazy loading operations
- [ ] Update all imports in codebase that reference `useLazyLoading.ts`


---

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Move File
Follow the subtasks for the file above.

### Step 2: Update Imports
After the file is moved, update all imports in the codebase that reference the old location.

### Step 3: Update Index File
Update the existing `index.ts` file in the hooks directory to export the utility hook.

### Step 4: Validate Migration
After the file is moved, run `task validate` and fix all issues.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… File Migration Verification
- [ ] Utility hook file moved to appropriate hooks directory
- [ ] All imports updated to use relative paths
- [ ] Index file updated to export utility hook
- [ ] All imports in codebase updated to reference new location

### âœ… Functionality Verification
- [ ] useLazyLoading hook works correctly
- [ ] All utility functionality preserved

### âœ… Code Quality Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] All hook logic preserved after moving
- [ ] No functionality broken

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… Utility hook file moved to hooks-specific directory
- âœ… Hook colocated with its usage
- âœ… All imports updated to use new location
- âœ… Index file updated to export utility hook
- âœ… All functionality preserved and working
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Path Errors
**Problem:** Import paths break after moving hook
**Solution:**
- Update all import statements to use relative paths
- Use IDE refactoring tools to update imports
- Check for any absolute imports that need updating

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after moving hook
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references that need updating
- Ensure all dependencies are properly imported
- Update any type definitions that reference the old location

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing hook import
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the moved hook
- Test the application thoroughly after the move
