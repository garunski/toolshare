# Phase 5e: Delete Form Validation Files

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Delete 2 over-engineered form validation files from `src/common/forms/` to remove unnecessary complexity and enforce colocation principles.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Delete (2 files)

### 1. `FormValidation.ts` (754B)
**Complexity:** Low | **Dependencies:** Minimal

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `FormValidation.ts` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this form validation utility
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/FormValidation.ts`


### 2. `validators/index.ts` (2.7KB)
**Complexity:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Some

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `validators/index.ts` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this validators index file
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/validators/index.ts`


---

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deletion Analysis
Before deleting each file, search for any imports or usage in the codebase.

### Step 2: Delete Files One by One
Delete each file in order of complexity (Low â†’ Medium).

### Step 3: Validate After Each Deletion
After each file is deleted, run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes.

### Step 4: Handle Import Errors
If any import errors occur, update the importing files to remove the dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deletion Verification
- [ ] All 2 form validation files identified for deletion
- [ ] No active usage found in codebase
- [ ] All dependencies identified and handled

### âœ… Deletion Verification
- [ ] FormValidation.ts deleted
- [ ] validators/index.ts deleted

### âœ… Post-Deletion Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by deletions
- [ ] All remaining forms still work correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 2 over-engineered form validation files deleted
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… No functionality broken by deletions
- âœ… All remaining forms still work correctly
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors After Deletion
**Problem:** Other files still import the deleted validation files
**Solution:**
- Search for all imports of the deleted file
- Remove the import statements
- Update the importing files to remove the dependency

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after deletion
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references to deleted validation files
- Update type definitions to remove dependencies
- Ensure all imports are properly updated

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing validation
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the deleted validation files
- Test the application thoroughly after each deletion
