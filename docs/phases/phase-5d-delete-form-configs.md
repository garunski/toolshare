# Phase 5d: Delete Form Configuration Files

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Delete 8 over-engineered form configuration files from `src/common/forms/configs/` to remove unnecessary complexity and enforce colocation principles.

- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/configs/profileSetupFormConfig.ts`


### 7. `loanRequestFormConfig.ts` (1.6KB)
**Complexity:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Some

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `loanRequestFormConfig.ts` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this loan request form configuration
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/configs/loanRequestFormConfig.ts`


### 8. `friendRequestFormConfig.ts` (706B)
**Complexity:** Low | **Dependencies:** Minimal

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deletion Analysis
Before deleting each file, search for any imports or usage in the codebase.

### Step 2: Delete Files One by One
Delete each file in order of complexity (Low â†’ Medium â†’ High).

### Step 3: Validate After Each Deletion
After each file is deleted, run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes.

### Step 4: Handle Import Errors
If any import errors occur, update the importing files to remove the dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deletion Verification
- [ ] All 8 form configuration files identified for deletion
- [ ] No active usage found in codebase
- [ ] All dependencies identified and handled

### âœ… Deletion Verification
- [ ] baseFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] addToolFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] addToolFormSteps.ts deleted
- [ ] loginFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] registerFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] profileSetupFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] loanRequestFormConfig.ts deleted
- [ ] friendRequestFormConfig.ts deleted

### âœ… Post-Deletion Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by deletions
- [ ] All remaining forms still work correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 8 over-engineered form configuration files deleted
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… No functionality broken by deletions
- âœ… All remaining forms still work correctly
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors After Deletion
**Problem:** Other files still import the deleted configuration files
**Solution:**
- Search for all imports of the deleted file
- Remove the import statements
- Update the importing files to remove the dependency

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after deletion
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references to deleted configurations
- Update type definitions to remove dependencies
- Ensure all imports are properly updated

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing configuration
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the deleted configurations
- Test the application thoroughly after each deletion
