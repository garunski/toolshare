# Phase 5f: Delete Utility Components

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Delete 2 over-engineered utility component files from `src/common/forms/` to remove unnecessary complexity and enforce colocation principles.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Delete (2 files)

### 1. `DatePicker.tsx` (6.2KB)
**Complexity:** High | **Dependencies:** Multiple

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `DatePicker.tsx` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this date picker component
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/DatePicker.tsx`


### 2. `index.ts` (999B)
**Complexity:** Low | **Dependencies:** Minimal

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `index.ts` from forms directory in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this forms index file
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/index.ts`


---

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deletion Analysis
Before deleting each file, search for any imports or usage in the codebase.

### Step 2: Delete Files One by One
Delete each file in order of complexity (Low â†’ High).

### Step 3: Validate After Each Deletion
After each file is deleted, run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes.

### Step 4: Handle Import Errors
If any import errors occur, update the importing files to remove the dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deletion Verification
- [ ] All 2 utility component files identified for deletion
- [ ] No active usage found in codebase
- [ ] All dependencies identified and handled

### âœ… Deletion Verification
- [ ] DatePicker.tsx deleted
- [ ] index.ts deleted

### âœ… Post-Deletion Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by deletions
- [ ] All remaining forms still work correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 2 over-engineered utility component files deleted
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… No functionality broken by deletions
- âœ… All remaining forms still work correctly
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors After Deletion
**Problem:** Other files still import the deleted utility components
**Solution:**
- Search for all imports of the deleted file
- Remove the import statements
- Update the importing files to use alternatives or remove the dependency

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after deletion
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references to deleted components
- Update type definitions to remove dependencies
- Ensure all imports are properly updated

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing utility components
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the deleted components
- Test the application thoroughly after each deletion
