# Phase 5c: Delete Form Field Components

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Delete 4 over-engineered form field component files from `src/common/forms/` to remove unnecessary complexity and enforce colocation principles.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Delete (4 files)

### 1. `FormField.tsx` (3.3KB)
**Complexity:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Some

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `FormField.tsx` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this form field component
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/FormField.tsx`
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 2. `FormFieldRenderers.tsx` (2.8KB)
**Complexity:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Some

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `FormFieldRenderers.tsx` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this field renderers component
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/FormFieldRenderers.tsx`
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 3. `DynamicField.tsx` (4.7KB)
**Complexity:** High | **Dependencies:** Multiple

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `DynamicField.tsx` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this dynamic field component
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/DynamicField.tsx`
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 4. `MultiSelect.tsx` (6.4KB)
**Complexity:** High | **Dependencies:** Multiple

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Check for any imports of `MultiSelect.tsx` in the codebase
- [ ] Verify no active usage of this multi-select component
- [ ] Delete `src/common/forms/MultiSelect.tsx`
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deletion Analysis
Before deleting each file, search for any imports or usage in the codebase.

### Step 2: Delete Files One by One
Delete each file in order of complexity (Medium â†’ High).

### Step 3: Validate After Each Deletion
After each file is deleted, run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes.

### Step 4: Handle Import Errors
If any import errors occur, update the importing files to remove the dependencies.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… Pre-Deletion Verification
- [ ] All 4 form field component files identified for deletion
- [ ] No active usage found in codebase
- [ ] All dependencies identified and handled

### âœ… Deletion Verification
- [ ] FormField.tsx deleted
- [ ] FormFieldRenderers.tsx deleted
- [ ] DynamicField.tsx deleted
- [ ] MultiSelect.tsx deleted

### âœ… Post-Deletion Verification
- [ ] Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] No functionality broken by deletions
- [ ] All remaining forms still work correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 4 over-engineered form field component files deleted
- âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… No functionality broken by deletions
- âœ… All remaining forms still work correctly
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Import Errors After Deletion
**Problem:** Other files still import the deleted field components
**Solution:**
- Search for all imports of the deleted file
- Remove the import statements
- Update the importing files to use primitives or remove the dependency

### Issue: TypeScript Errors
**Problem:** TypeScript compilation fails after deletion
**Solution:**
- Check for any type references to deleted components
- Update type definitions to remove dependencies
- Ensure all imports are properly updated

### Issue: Runtime Errors
**Problem:** Application crashes due to missing field components
**Solution:**
- Check for any dynamic imports or lazy loading
- Update any code that references the deleted components
- Test the application thoroughly after each deletion
