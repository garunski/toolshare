# Phase 2: Destroy the `src/common/` Directory

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Move everything from `src/common/` to where it actually belongs, eliminating the anti-pattern of scattered business logic, forms, hooks, and validators.

---

## ðŸš¨ Current State Analysis

**Problem:** Everything is in the wrong place
```
src/common/
â”œâ”€â”€ operations/ (60+ files) - Business logic scattered everywhere
â”œâ”€â”€ forms/ (15+ files) - Over-engineered form system
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/ (20+ files) - Hooks that should be colocated
â”œâ”€â”€ validators/ (15+ files) - Validation not with forms/APIs
â”œâ”€â”€ components/ (2 files) - Should be in pages
â”œâ”€â”€ formatters/ (4 files) - Utilities that should be colocated
â”œâ”€â”€ calculators/ (empty) - Meaningless abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ generators/ (empty) - Meaningless abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ parsers/ (empty) - Meaningless abstraction
â”œâ”€â”€ transformers/ (empty) - Meaningless abstraction
â””â”€â”€ supabase/ (3 files) - Only thing that should stay shared
```

**Impact:**
- Business logic scattered across 60+ files
- Forms over-engineered and not colocated
- Hooks not with their components
- Validation not with forms/APIs
- No clear ownership of code
- Difficult to maintain and understand

---

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Identify What to Keep vs Move

**KEEP in `src/common/supabase/`:**
```
src/common/supabase/
â”œâ”€â”€ client.ts - Supabase client configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts - Server-side Supabase client
â””â”€â”€ middleware.ts - Supabase middleware utilities
```

**MOVE everything else:**
```
src/common/operations/ â†’ Move to API routes (Phase 3)
src/common/forms/ â†’ Move to pages (Phase 5)
src/common/hooks/ â†’ Move to components (Phase 6)
src/common/validators/ â†’ Move to forms/APIs (Phase 4)
src/common/components/ â†’ Move to pages
src/common/formatters/ â†’ Move to where used
src/common/calculators/ â†’ DELETE (empty)
src/common/generators/ â†’ DELETE (empty)
src/common/parsers/ â†’ DELETE (empty)
src/common/transformers/ â†’ DELETE (empty)
```

### Step 2: Create Backup and Analysis

**Before moving anything, create a backup and analyze dependencies:**

```bash
# Create backup of current common directory
cp -r src/common src/common.backup

# Analyze what's in each directory
find src/common -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -20

# Check import dependencies
grep -r "from '@/common" src/ | head -20
```

### Step 3: Move Supabase Files to New Location

**Create the new supabase directory structure:**

```bash
# Create new supabase directory
mkdir -p src/common/supabase

# Move existing supabase files
mv src/common/supabase/client.ts src/common/supabase/client.ts
mv src/common/supabase/server.ts src/common/supabase/server.ts
mv src/common/supabase/middleware.ts src/common/supabase/middleware.ts
```

### Step 4: Prepare Directories for Other Phases

**Create placeholder directories for other phases to move files to:**

```bash
# Create directories for Phase 3 (Business Logic)
mkdir -p src/app/api/\(app\)/tools/create
mkdir -p src/app/api/\(app\)/tools/list
mkdir -p src/app/api/admin/users/create
mkdir -p src/app/api/admin/users/list

# Create directories for Phase 4 (Validation)
mkdir -p src/app/\(app\)/tools/add/validation
mkdir -p src/app/\(auth\)/login/validation
mkdir -p src/app/\(auth\)/register/validation

# Create directories for Phase 5 (Forms)
mkdir -p src/app/\(app\)/tools/add/components
mkdir -p src/app/\(auth\)/login/components
mkdir -p src/app/\(auth\)/register/components

# Create directories for Phase 6 (Hooks)
mkdir -p src/app/\(app\)/tools/add/hooks
mkdir -p src/app/\(app\)/tools/browse/hooks
mkdir -p src/app/admin/users/hooks
```

### Step 5: Delete Empty Directories

**Remove meaningless abstraction directories:**

```bash
# Delete empty directories
rm -rf src/common/calculators
rm -rf src/common/generators
rm -rf src/common/parsers
rm -rf src/common/transformers
```

### Step 6: Document What Needs to Be Moved

**Create a migration plan for other phases:**

```bash
# Create migration tracking file
cat > PHASE2_MIGRATION_PLAN.md << 'EOF'
# Phase 2 Migration Plan

## Files to be moved in Phase 3 (Business Logic)
- src/common/operations/toolCRUD.ts â†’ src/app/api/(app)/tools/create/performTool.ts
- src/common/operations/toolQueries.ts â†’ src/app/api/(app)/tools/list/getTools.ts
- src/common/operations/userCreation.ts â†’ src/app/api/admin/users/create/performUser.ts
- src/common/operations/roleAssignments.ts â†’ src/app/api/admin/roles/assign/performRoleAssignment.ts
- (60+ other operation files)

## Files to be moved in Phase 4 (Validation)
- src/common/validators/toolCreationValidator.ts â†’ src/app/(app)/tools/add/validation/validateTool.ts
- src/common/validators/loginValidator.ts â†’ src/app/(auth)/login/validation/validateLogin.ts
- src/common/validators/registerValidator.ts â†’ src/app/(auth)/register/validation/validateRegister.ts
- (15+ other validator files)

## Files to be moved in Phase 5 (Forms)
- src/common/forms/AddToolForm.tsx â†’ src/app/(app)/tools/add/components/AddToolForm/index.tsx
- src/common/forms/RegisterForm.tsx â†’ src/app/(auth)/register/components/RegisterForm/index.tsx
- src/common/forms/LoginForm.tsx â†’ src/app/(auth)/login/components/LoginForm/index.tsx
- DELETE: FormBuilder.tsx, MultiStepFormBuilder.tsx, DynamicFormBuilder.tsx

## Files to be moved in Phase 6 (Hooks)
- src/common/hooks/useAddToolForm.ts â†’ src/app/(app)/tools/add/hooks/useAddToolForm.ts
- src/common/hooks/useCategorySuggestions.ts â†’ src/app/(app)/tools/add/hooks/useCategorySuggestions.ts
- src/common/hooks/useToolSearch.ts â†’ src/app/(app)/tools/browse/hooks/useToolSearch.ts
- src/common/hooks/useAuth.ts â†’ src/common/supabase/hooks/useAuth.ts
- (20+ other hook files)

## Files to be moved immediately
- src/common/components/ â†’ Move to appropriate pages
- src/common/formatters/ â†’ Move to where used
EOF
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Circular Dependencies
**Problem:** Moving files creates circular import dependencies
**Solution:** 
- Analyze dependencies before moving
- Move files in dependency order
- Use dependency injection where necessary

### Issue: Missing Files
**Problem:** Files accidentally deleted during cleanup
**Solution:**
- Always create backup first
- Use `git status` to track changes
- Test after each step

### Issue: Import Paths
**Problem:** Import statements break after moving files
**Solution:**
- Update imports in other phases
- Use search and replace for common patterns
- Run TypeScript compiler to catch errors

*Phase 2 focuses on preparing the destruction of the common directory by identifying what needs to be moved, creating the proper structure, and documenting the migration plan for subsequent phases.*
