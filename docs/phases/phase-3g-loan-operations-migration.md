# Phase 3g: Loan Operations Migration

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Move 3 loan operation files from `src/common/operations/` to be colocated with API routes in `/api/(app)/loans/`. Run `task validate` after each task and fix all issuesfu

---

## ðŸ“‹ Files to Migrate (3 files)

### 1. `loanStatusOperations.ts` â†’ `/api/(app)/loans/status/performStatusUpdate.ts`
**Size:** 2.1KB | **Complexity:** Medium

**Subtasks:**
- [x]  Create directory: `src/app/api/(app)/loans/status/`
- [x]  Copy `loanStatusOperations.ts` to `performStatusUpdate.ts`
- [x]  Refactor function names to be specific (e.g., `performStatusUpdate`, `updateLoanStatus`, `getLoanStatus`)
- [x]  Update imports to use `@/common/supabase/server`
- [x]  Add loan status update validation logic
- [x]  Add status transition rules and validation
- [x]  Add notification handling for status changes
- [x]  Create corresponding `route.ts` file
- [x]  Update all imports in codebase that reference `loanStatusOperations.ts`

### 2. `loanStatusTracker.ts` â†’ `/api/(app)/loans/tracking/trackLoanStatus.ts`
**Size:** 2.1KB | **Complexity:** Medium

**Subtasks:**
- [x]  Create directory: `src/app/api/(app)/loans/tracking/`
- [x]  Copy `loanStatusTracker.ts` to `trackLoanStatus.ts`
- [x]  Refactor function names to be specific (e.g., `trackLoanStatus`, `getLoanTracking`, `updateLoanTracking`)
- [x]  Update imports to use `@/common/supabase/server`
- [x]  Add loan status tracking logic
- [x]  Add tracking history and audit trail
- [x]  Add automated status updates based on time/conditions
- [x]  Create corresponding `route.ts` file
- [x]  Update all imports in codebase that reference `loanStatusTracker.ts`

### 3. `realtimeConnectionManager.ts` â†’ `/api/(app)/loans/realtime/manageConnections.ts`
**Size:** 4.1KB | **Complexity:** High

**Subtasks:**
- [x]  Create directory: `src/app/api/(app)/loans/realtime/`
- [x]  Copy `realtimeConnectionManager.ts` to `manageConnections.ts`
- [x]  Refactor function names to be specific (e.g., `manageConnections`, `handleRealtimeConnection`, `broadcastLoanUpdate`)
- [x]  Update imports to use `@/common/supabase/server`
- [x]  Add real-time connection management logic
- [x]  Add WebSocket connection handling
- [x]  Add real-time loan status broadcasting
- [x]  Add connection pooling and optimization
- [x]  Create corresponding `route.ts` file
- [x]  Update all imports in codebase that reference `realtimeConnectionManager.ts`

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/api/\(app\)/loans/status
mkdir -p src/app/api/\(app\)/loans/tracking
mkdir -p src/app/api/\(app\)/loans/realtime
```

### Step 2: Move Files One by One
Follow the subtasks for each file above, moving them in order of complexity (Medium â†’ High).

### Step 3: Update Imports
After each file is moved, update all imports in the codebase that reference the old location.

### Step 4: Create Route Files
For each moved operation file, create a corresponding `route.ts` file that uses the business logic.

### Step 5: Test Each Migration
After each file is moved, test the functionality to ensure it works correctly.

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

### âœ… File Migration Verification
- [x]  All 3 loan operation files moved to appropriate API routes
- [x]  All function names refactored to be specific and descriptive
- [x]  All imports updated to use `@/common/supabase/server`
- [x]  All corresponding `route.ts` files created
- [x]  All imports in codebase updated to reference new locations

### âœ… Code Quality Verification
- [x]  Run `task validate` to ensure no TypeScript errors
- [x]  Run `task dev:code-quality` to ensure code quality standards
- [x]  All business logic preserved after moving
- [x]  No functionality broken

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- âœ… All 3 loan operation files moved to `/api/(app)/loans/` structure
- âœ… Business logic colocated with API endpoints
- âœ… All imports updated to use new locations
- âœ… All corresponding route files created
- âœ… All functionality preserved and working
- âœ… Run `task validate` to ensure no breaking changes
