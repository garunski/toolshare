# Phase 6i: Cleanup and Final Validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Complete the Phase 6 migration by cleaning up the empty hooks directory and performing final validation.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Remove Empty Hooks Directory
**Priority:** Critical

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Verify all hook files have been moved from `src/common/hooks/`
- [ ] Check for any remaining files in the hooks directory
- [ ] Remove the empty `src/common/hooks/` directory
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 2. Update Remaining Import References
**Priority:** Critical

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Search for any remaining imports referencing `@/common/hooks/`
- [ ] Update all remaining import statements to use new locations
- [ ] Check for any TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 3. Verify All Hooks Work
**Priority:** High

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Verify all tool hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all admin hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all attribute hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all social hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all mobile/touch hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all utility hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Verify all shared hooks are properly imported
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 4. Clean Up Empty Directories
**Priority:** Medium

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Find and remove any empty directories created during migration
- [ ] Ensure directory structure is clean and organized
- [ ] Run `task validate` and fix all issues

### 5. Final Validation and Testing
**Priority:** Critical

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Run comprehensive `task validate` to ensure no errors
- [ ] Verify all hook functionality is preserved
- [ ] Check that no functionality is broken
- [ ] Ensure all imports are working correctly

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Migration Completion
Check that all hook files have been successfully moved to their new locations.

### Step 2: Remove Empty Directory
Remove the now-empty `src/common/hooks/` directory.

### Step 3: Update Remaining Imports
Find and update any remaining import statements that reference the old hooks directory.

### Step 4: Clean Up Structure
Remove any empty directories and ensure clean organization.

### Step 5: Final Validation
Run `task validate` to ensure everything is working correctly.

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Missing Import Updates
**Problem:** Some imports still reference the old hooks directory
**Solution:**
- Use search and replace to find all remaining references
- Update imports to use new hook locations
- Run TypeScript compiler to catch any missing imports

### Issue: Empty Directory Removal
**Problem:** Cannot remove directory that appears to have files
**Solution:**
- Check for hidden files or subdirectories
- Ensure all files have been moved
- Use `find` command to locate any remaining files

### Issue: Hook Functionality Errors
**Problem:** Hooks not working after migration
**Solution:**
- Check that all imports are correctly updated
- Verify that hook components are properly implemented
- Ensure TypeScript types are correctly defined
