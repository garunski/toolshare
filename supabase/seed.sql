-- Seed data for development/testing
-- Note: This seed file is currently empty because profiles are created automatically
-- when users register through Supabase Auth. Sample data will be added
-- when real users register and create their profiles.

-- For now, we'll leave this empty to avoid foreign key constraint issues
-- with the auth.users table. Sample data can be added manually through
-- the Supabase Studio interface or when users register.
